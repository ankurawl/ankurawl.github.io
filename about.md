# Me: Ankur Aggarwal 

Technology Products Leader with 20+ years of experience driving Product Strategy, Growth, Execution, Metrics, User Research, Customer Experience and more. 

My experience spans entire lifecycle of technology products including building 0 to 1 products (Amazon's Junglee.com, Alexa enabled microwave), consumer and long tail B2B products (Amazon Prime for Students, Amazon Seller Lending), consumer hardware (Logitech Smart Set-top box, Amazon Alexa microwave), and enterprise grade internal tooling (Amazon scale Recruiting, Meta scale User Research). 

My latest passion is to leverage AI to imagine and build new product capabilities that were not possible due to technology or business constraints.
